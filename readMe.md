# AA-Translator

## Purpose: Make an javascript program to translate multiple nucleic acid sequences to amino acid sequences. The input will be transformed into an array which the program will use for the translation. The obvious inputs would be from an excel `.csv` or from a FASTA `.txt` file as text. 

--- 

### Phase 1
- [x] Create a conversion table for each amino acid
- [x] Parse a nucleic acid's text into 3 letter array
- [x] Translate NA to AA individually
- [x] Write a for loop translating each NA to AA and push it to a string
- [x] Create a html with a prompt to enter NA sequence
- [x] Connect onclick to initiate translation
- [x] Create an output box with AA sequence
- [x] Connect output to display translated AA sequence
- [x] GIT this

---

### Phase 2 - multiple frames
- [x] create 2 more output boxes for frames 2 and 3
- [ ] edit javascript to remove 1 or 2 nucleic acids from the input string
- [ ] create additonal steps to translate these new strings to the new output boxes
