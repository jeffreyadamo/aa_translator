# AA-Translator

## Purpose: Make an javascript program to translate multiple nucleic acid sequences to amino acid sequences. The input will be transformed into an array which the program will use for the translation. The obvious inputs would be from an excel .csv or from a FASTA .txt file as text. 

### Notes
[x] Create a conversion table for each amino acid
[x] Parse a nucleic acid's text into 3 letter array
[x] Translate NA to AA individually
[x] Write a for loop translating each NA to AA and push it to a string
[ ] Create a html with a prompt to enter NA sequence
